# Error Code: 13005

> ❗️ "Failed to save DSL V1 config: \{error\_detail}"
>
> This is referring to an DSL field that has an invalid DSL rule.

The \{error\_detail} should tell you the DSL error & where it's located.

For example, `Failed to save DSL V1 config: **Empty DSL expression** for field [**launch_config**.user_allow_list_config.allowlist_rule]` tells us we have an empty launch config.

# Error Code: 13121

> ❗️ "There are errors with the field: \{error\_detail}"
>
> For example, you use an invalid character when naming your connector

The \{error\_detail} should give you enough information to resolve this error.

As a reminder, connectors can only use lowercase, uppercase, and underscore characters.
