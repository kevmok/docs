If you're building for our [Classic Plugins](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/classic-plugins-troubleshooting), the [data bank](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/http-action-data-bank) is slightly different.

# Paths Workspace Data Bank

All of the variables that come from Paths Questions will be auto-populated in the `Input Variables` tab as a quick reference.

# Queries Workspace Data Bank

**In Queries Workspace**, you can use the `query` keyword + any User Attributes you have configured as variables.

All of the variables that come from the `query` keyword will be auto-populated in the `Input Variables` tab as a quick reference.
