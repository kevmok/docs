# `meta_info`

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {			
  	"meta_info": {
  		"user": {
  			...
  		},
  		"action_instance_id": "{{uuid}}"
  	}
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## `meta_info.user`

We can access the user attributes of the user who triggered the action (via a Plugin) with the following notation **`meta_info.user.<attribute>`**. [View all of the available user attributes here.](/docs/user-attribute-reference)

For example, if you wanted to use the current user's email, you would reference it like `{{meta_info.user.email_addr}}`

## `meta_info.action_instance_id`

This is a unique ID provided when the AI agent attempts to execute this HTTP action. You can use it as an idempotency key (deduplicate retry calls).
