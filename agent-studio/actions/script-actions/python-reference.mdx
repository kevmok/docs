The **Python Script Actions** environment is the standard code execution platform, offering broader capabilities than **APIthon**, including access to a pre-approved and verified list of external libraries.

All Python built-in libraries are available (e.g., `json`, `datetime`, `re`, `collections`, `math`). The following **external libraries** are also supported:

| Library                             | Version  | Primary Use                                                                                                                                                     |

# Limitations & Callouts

The Python Script Actions environment has specific restrictions to ensure security and stability.

## Execution Timeout

<Callout icon="⚠️" theme="error">
  **8-Second Hard Timeout**: Script execution is strictly limited to 8 seconds. This is a hard limit enforced at the infrastructure level to protect system stability—there are no exceptions. Design your scripts to process data efficiently and avoid heavy computations or large iterations.
</Callout>

## Internet Access

Internet access is disabled at the infrastructure level. While network libraries like `requests` can be imported, **all outbound network calls will fail at runtime**.

To use data from external systems:
1. Retrieve the data using **HTTP Actions** first
2. Pass the data into your Python script as input arguments

## File System Warning

<Callout icon="❗️" theme="error">
  **Do not use the file system.** While you technically have access to a `/tmp` directory, we **strongly discourage** any file system interaction.

  - Files written to `/tmp` are automatically deleted at the end of each request
  - If deletion fails, your execution environment may become locked
  - A locked environment will cause **all Python script executions for your user to fail** until the underlying infrastructure recycles your environment
  - There is no manual recovery process—you must wait for automatic recycling
</Callout>

If you need to process data, keep it in memory and return results directly.

## Security Warning

<Callout icon="❗️">
  Until a formal code review capability is introduced, any admin has the ability to modify or publish a full Python script in Agent Studio without a secondary approval step. This means that if an admin account were ever compromised, an attacker could immediately author and deploy malicious scripts at will. Implementing a structured review process will be critical to reducing this risk and ensuring the integrity of scripts executed within your AI Assistant.
</Callout>

# How to use Python Script Actions

Python Script Actions can be integrated into **Compound Actions** and **Conversational Processes** within the agent studio. This section explains how to define and reference the data collected from the user (slots) within your Python script.

The fundamental concept to remember is that the script's output is determined by the value of the **last line of code executed**.

## 1. Defining and Mapping the Input Argument

For your Python script to use data collected from the user (a "slot"), you must define an **Input Argument** and then map the collected **slot value** to that argument.

* **Define the Slot:** When building the plugin using a **conversational process** or **compound action** you must define a **required slot** (e.g., init_number) that the AI Assistant collects from the user. This information will be collected from the user during Plugin execution.

* **Defining the Python Script:** When selecting the Script Action during the build you can **pass Input Arguments** to it from a **slot** we have already fulfilled (e.g., init_number) that specifies the expected Data Type (e.g., integer) and whether it is Required.

  <Image align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/14ee6647665909d803857b8fe95e0d69bf4bb9823f8d7a3ba960b08c8dbc5aeb-Screenshot_2025-11-14_at_9.28.34AM.png" className="border" />

  * You will also need to Select the **Slot** we created earlier under **Required Slots** so the Slot is collected and passed as an input to the Script Action.

## 2. Referencing the Slot in the Python Script

Once the Input Mapping is configured, We can now define the Python code in the Script Action. In order to do this you need to select **Python** in the Code Executor dropdown.

<Image align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/30c1c79eb377d842c18778fd02ec915bb1af17cdc21b30096e719689e13bada2-image.png" className="border" />

the slot value collected (e.g., 9) is available directly inside the Python function under the name of the **Input Argument** (init_number).

* **Creating the Input Argument:** Inside the Script Action you will need to define an **Input Argument** which will store the slot value being passed from the previous step. The slot value collected (e.g., 9) is available directly inside the Python function under the name of the **Input Argument** (init_number).

  <Image align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/0e4fa6e80e5ff45da1535164d4e856e1dd560359e97c08d97d81aec10aad5084-image.png" className="border" />
* **Using Input Arguments In the Script:** Once the Arguments have been set, we can now reference them in the Python Code by using the name of the Input Argument directly **init_number**. You can then run any lines of code on this.

  <Image align="center" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/f16e1d1b422b90a790428c5cd2a920903d8f46f759ea7dd65a2ec6e65adf71ec-image.png" className="border" />
* **Returning the Result:** Once the code has been executed we need to ensure the last line of the script is returning the required information back which will be stored in the **output_key** defined by the user. In this example I have initialised **variable 'm'** as an empty String where the final result will be stored.

<Callout icon="❗️" theme="error">
  **Ensure the correct Data Type is being selected for Slots, Input Arguments across steps to keep them aligned.**
</Callout>

# Troubleshooting

* Remember to use **|** after **code**: to tell the editor that you're about to write multiline code
* Make sure your indentation is correct - Python is very picky about this!
* The last line of your code is what gets saved to your output_key
* Use the **Test button** in the Script Action to verify the code.
