# Using Script Actions

In Pre-April 2025 versions of the Plugin Workspace, Script Actions are defined in a [Compound Actions](/docs/compound-actions). In Post-April 2025 versions of the Plugin Workspace, Script Actions can be defined independently and referenced in either [Compound Actions](/docs/compound-actions) or [Plugins](/docs/ai-agents-and-plugins).

To provide a secure runtime, each Script Action adds non-negligible latency to your plugins. Please make sure to use [DSL](/docs/moveworks-dsl-reference) and our [Data Mapper](/docs/moveworks-bender-language-reference) for common data transformation operations.

## Option 1: Creating a standalone Script Action

You can create a script action inside of plugin workspace, under the Actions > Script Actions Tab. Once created, this action can be referenced inside of plugins through Action Activities.

## Option 2: Creating a Script Action inside of a compound action

You can insert a script action using the `script` keyword.

## Fields for entry

The following fields are relevant for Script Actions, regardless of which setup flow you followed (standalone vs. in a compound action).

**Fields:**

* **`output_key`:** A variable to store the result of the action.

  * **Type:** `str`
  * **Mandatory:** Yes

* **`input_args`:** A dictionary mapping input arguments to their values, allowing for dynamic inputs to the action.

  * **Type:** `dictionary` `{}` - Accepts [Moveworks Data Mapping Syntax](/docs/moveworks-bender-language-reference)
  * **Mandatory:** No

* **`code`**: A string that represents the code to execute.

  * **Type:** `str`
  * **Mandatory:** Yes

# Supported Languages

Moveworks currently supports a variation of Python called APIthon. This provides a familiar and powerful scripting environment for developers.

Follow [our roadmap item](https://community.moveworks.com/ideas/actions-python-1522) to be the first to get full Python support in your instance.
