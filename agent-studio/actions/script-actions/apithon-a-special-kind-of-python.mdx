# How APIthon Works

The most important thing to remember about APIthon is that it returns the result from the **last line of code**

Let's look at some examples:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  cookies = 5
  more_cookies = 3
  cookies + more_cookies
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will give us back 8, because adding cookies is the last thing we did! But if we write:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  cookies = 5
  cookies + 3
  more_cookies = 2
  ```
</CodeGroup>

We won't get anything back, because the last thing we did was just make a new variable!

# Python vs. APIthon

## Capabilities

1. **No Imports**

   * You cannot import any external modules or packages
   * You can only use the built-in functions that are available

2. **No Classes**

   * You cannot define new classes
   * You must work with existing data types

3. **No Private Methods or Properties**

   * Anything that starts with an underscore (\_) is off-limits
   * This includes both methods and variables

4. **No External Code**

   * All code must be self-contained
   * No accessing external resources

5. **No Multiple Language Support**

   * APIthon only works with Python-style syntax
   * No mixing with other programming languages

## Size Limits

APIthon also has some size limits:

* Your code can't be too long (4096 bytes)
* Your lists can't have too many things in them (2096 bytes)
* Your numbers can't be too big or too small (4294967296)
* Your words (strings) can't be too long (4096 bytes/characters)

# Using APIthon

## Common Operations

APIthon supports many common operations across different data types. Here are the most useful ones you'll likely use:

### Working with Numbers (Integers and Floats)

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  # Basic math operations
  number = 5
  other = 3
  number + other # Addition
  number - other # Subtraction
  number * other # Multiplication
  number / other # Division
  number // other # Floor division
  number % other # Modulus (remainder)
  number ** other # Power# Comparison
  number > other # Greater than
  number < other # Less than
  number >= other # Greater than or equal
  number <= other # Less than or equal
  number == other # Equal to
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Working with Text (Strings)

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  text = "Hello"
  other = "World"

  # String operations
  text + other # Joining strings
  text * 3 # Repeat string
  text.split() # Split into list
  text.join(['a','b']) # Join list into string
  text.replace('l', 'w') # Replace characters
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Working with Lists

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  my_list = [1, 2, 3]

  # List operations
  my_list.append(4) # Add item to end
  my_list.pop() # Remove and return last item
  my_list.remove(2) # Remove specific item
  my_list.index(1) # Find position of item
  my_list.sort() # Sort the list
  my_list.reverse() # Reverse the list
  len(my_list) # Get length of list
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Working with Sets

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  set_a = {1, 2, 3}
  set_b = {3, 4, 5}

  # Set operations
  set_a.add(4) # Add item
  set_a.remove(2) # Remove item
  set_a & set_b # Intersection
  set_a | set_b # Union
  set_a - set_b # Difference
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Working with Dictionaries

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  my_dict = {"name": "Alice"}

  # Dictionary operations
  my_dict["age"] = 20 # Add/update item
  my_dict.get("name") # Get value safely
  my_dict.keys() # Get all keys
  my_dict.values() # Get all values
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Common Built-in Functions

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  len(something) # Get length
  str(42) # Convert to string
  int("42") # Convert to integer
  float("42.5") # Convert to float
  bool(1) # Convert to boolean
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember these important points about functions in APIthon:

* All functions return values (just like in a Python shell)
* The last operation's result is what gets returned
* There are limits on how many operations you can perform
* If a function name starts with underscore (\_), you can't use it

## APIthon Examples

### Example 1: Joining a list of strings

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  script:
    output_key: uppercase_names
    input_args:
      names: data.user_list.names
    code: "','.join(names)"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This takes a list of names and join them together into a single string!

**Sample Input Payload:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  data.user_list.names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Result:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  Alice,Bob,Charlie
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Example 2: Calculating Total Points

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  script:
    output_key: total_score
    input_args:
      scores: data.game_results.points
    code: "total = 0; [total := total + score for score in scores if score > 0]; total"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This adds up all the positive scores in a list!

**Sample Input Payload:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  data.game_results.points = [10, -5, 20, 0, 15]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Result:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  45
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### **Example 3: Organizing a Pet Directory**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  script:
    output_key: pet_summary
    input_args:
      pets: data.pet_store.animals
    code: |
      pet_types = {}

      for pet in pets:
          pet_type = pet.get('type')
          if pet_type not in pet_types:
              pet_types[pet_type] = []
          pet_types[pet_type].append(pet.get('name'))

      summary = ""
      for pet_type in pet_types:
          names = pet_types[pet_type]
          summary += f"We have {len(names)} {pet_type}(s):\n"
          for name in names:
              summary += f"- {name}\n"
          summary += "\n"

      summary
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This organizes a list of pets by type and creates a nice summary!

**Sample Input Payload:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  data.pet_store.animals = [
      {"type": "dog", "name": "Buddy"},
      {"type": "cat", "name": "Whiskers"},
      {"type": "dog", "name": "Max"},
      {"type": "fish", "name": "Nemo"}
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Result:**

```
We have 2 dog(s):
- Buddy
- Max

We have 1 cat(s):
- Whiskers

We have 1 fish(s):
- Nemo
```

### **Example 4: Grade Calculator**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  script:
    output_key: grade_report
    input_args:
      grades: data.student_records.scores
    code: |
      def calculate_grade(score):
          if score >= 90: return 'A'
          if score >= 80: return 'B'
          if score >= 70: return 'C'
          if score >= 60: return 'D'
          return 'F'

      total = 0
      grade_counts = {'A': 0, 'B': 0, 'C': 0, 'D': 0, 'F': 0}

      for score in grades:
          total += score
          grade = calculate_grade(score)
          grade_counts[grade] += 1

      average = total / len(grades)

      report = f"Class Average: {average:.2f}\n\nGrade Distribution:\n"
      for grade, count in grade_counts.items():
          report += f"Grade {grade}: {count} students\n"

      report
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This takes a list of grades, calculates statistics, and creates a detailed report!

**Sample Input Payload:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash

  data.student_records.scores = [95, 82, 74, 65, 88, 90, 55, 89, 92, 78]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Result:**

```
Class Average: 80.80

Grade Distribution:
Grade A: 3 students
Grade B: 4 students
Grade C: 1 students
Grade D: 1 students
Grade F: 1 students
```

# Troubleshooting

* Remember to use `|` after `code: `to tell the editor that you're about to write multiline code
* Make sure your indentation is correct - Python is very picky about this!
* The last line of your code is what gets saved to your `output_key`
* Be aware of the size limits when working with collections
