title: "Compound Actions"
description: "Compound Actions empower developers to build sophisticated, multi-step automations within Agent Studio, chaining actions, data transformations, and logic into reusable AI workflows."
---

Think of Compound Actions as an orchestration layer that can:

* [Collect input arguments](/docs/compound-action-input-arguments/) from data sources
* [Execute actions](/docs/action/) to complete tasks
* [Conditionally run](/docs/switch/) different branches of logic
* [Loop over items](/docs/for/) and run steps for each item
* [Run steps at the same time](/docs/parallel/)
* [Return information](/docs/return/) to the user or processes
* [Handle error gracefully](/docs/try-catch-and-raise-error/)
* [Notify users](/docs/notify/) with interactive messages and buttons

## Why Use Compound Actions

* **Modularity**: Break down monolithic agents into testable, composable steps.
* **Efficiency**: Parallelize tasks or loop over lists to cut execution time.
* **Resilience**: Built-in error handling and early exits keep workflows robust.
* **Interactivity**: Notify users mid-flow with buttons for seamless handoffs.

## The `steps` Key

The `steps` key defines a sequence of expressions executed in order, forming the backbone of multi-step Compound Actions. It groups logic cleanly, ensuring predictable flow while enabling nesting for controls like `switch` or `parallel`. Use it whenever chaining more than one expression, it's required for compound structures to maintain order and scope.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  steps:
    - action:
        action_name: fetch_user_data
        output_key: user_info
        input_args:
          user_id: data.requestor_id
    - switch:  # Nested control
        cases:
          - condition: user_info.role == "admin"
            steps:
              - return:
                  output_mapper:
                    access: '''granted'''
  ```

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Moveworks [Data Mappers](/docs/moveworks-bender-language-reference) and [DSL](/docs/moveworks-dsl-reference)

2. **Use the Low Code Editor**: Get started fast with the low code editor. Switching back to code mode will generate the compound action script for you and viceversa.

<Warning>
  ### Low Code Editor LP

  *The Low Code Editor is still in development. Expect its release in October 2025*
</Warning>

<Info>
  ### Comments

  *YAML comments (`#`) are supported and preserved during edits, but switching between low-code and code views will strip them.*
