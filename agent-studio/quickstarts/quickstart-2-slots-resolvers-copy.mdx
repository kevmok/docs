title: "Quickstart #2: Slots & Resolvers"
---

# Learning Objectives

In this Quickstart guide, you'll build on the core concepts covered in [Quickstart #1](/docs/quickstart-basic-task-agent), and we'll build a more complex Task Agent that will **enable a user to find and update a feature request**. As part of the building process you'll learn how to:

* Build a [Data Type](/docs/data-types) to represent a feature request object.
* Create a [Resolver Strategy](/docs/resolver-strategies) that enables an AI Agent to find feature requests when it needs one
* Set up a Plugin that can use the Data Type & Resolver Strategy to power the process of finding the right feature request that a user wants to update.

# What You'll Build

The Plugin you're about to build solves a simple, but real-world problem: enable users to find and update a feature request.

Before starting to build, we always recommend that you first map out the desired **end user experience** and the overall **building blocks of the Conversational Process**.

Here is an example of the **end-user experience** we hope to enable:

![](/images/docs/63cdbf8521fd54a791e4a192fc4dfc503ebc1945aaa25c648d08f502cbe217ff-purple-chat_1.png)

To get to this experience, you can set up a **Data Type** to represent a "feature request" object, and your core **Conversational Process** should consist of one *Activity* (powered by an HTTP Action) and two Slots required in order to run the Activity:

<Frame caption="Left: Data Type. Right: Conversational Process (does not require any Decision Policies).">
  <img src="/images/docs/61e2ce9fb2602992a436d8d51c7fb82cc8b5df8303e626f8468f6e79c5dde823-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_02.14.05.png" />
</Frame>

You'll build an end-to-end working Plugin via these phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up HTTP Actions">
    Set up **2 [HTTP Actions](/docs/actions)**: one to fetch available feature requests, and another to update a feature request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Data Type & Resolver Strategy">
    Set up a **"feature request" [Data Type](/docs/data-types)**, and attach a **default [Resolver Strategy](/docs/resolver-strategies) to power a feature request object** (using the "fetch" Action you created in the previous phase).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build the Conversational Process">
    Build the **Conversational Process**, containing the 1 Activity (using your other "update" Action) and the 2 Slots, as illustrated above.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch a Plugin">
    Add the Conversational Process to your AI Agent by launching a Plugin.
  </Step>
</Steps>

*Let's get started!*

# Phase 0: Generate a Unique Session ID & Set Up Your Connector

<Warning>
  ### Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment

  1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>`
     1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
  2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card
</Warning>

<Info>
  ### You may be able to skip this phase if you've completed another Agent Studio Quickstart guide.

  *You can skip Phase 0 and move onto Phase 1A if:*

  1. You have already created a `firstname_lastname_moveworks_purple` connector, AND
  2. You already have your unique "Session ID" on hand.

  This section will walk you through how to set up your own connector to the Moveworks Purple API (which powers the Actions used in the Quickstart guides), so no need to repeat this step if you've done it before.
</Info>

In this guide, you'll build a Plugin that will actually fetch from and take action on a store of feature requests that's **set up just for you**. In preparation for this, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Session ID">
    Go to the [Moveworks Purple API Tool](purple-api-tool).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Session">
    Click "Create New Session ID". You should see sample feature requests populate below.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Session ID">
    Copy your **Session ID** to your own notes. You'll to have this on hand in the following phase when we set up your Actions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now, you just need to set up a (reusable) connector that will allow you to seamlessly hit the necessary Actions that your Plugin will use.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open App Picker">
    Navigate to the App Picker in the top right corner of Agent Studio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to HTTP Connectors">
    Click on "HTTP Connectors", which will take you to another browser tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Connector">
    Click "Create" in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Connector">
    Fill out the following information for your Connector (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information).

    | Field               | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info) |
    | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Connection Name** | `firstname_lastname_moveworks_purple`                            |
    | **Description**     | `Moveworks Purple APIs Connector`                                |
    | **Base Url**        | `https://marketplace.moveworks.com`                              |
    | **Auth Config**     | `No Auth`                                                        |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Connector">
    Click "Save" on the bottom right corner.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Phase 1A: Set Up Your "Fetch Feature Requests" Action

<Warning>
  ### Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment

  1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>`
     1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
  2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card
</Warning>

Let's first set up an [HTTP Action](/docs/http-actions) that will fetch available feature requests. This Action doesn't require any dynamic inputs, and will just query an external system for a list of feature requests.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Agent Studio">
    Navigate to the App Picker in the top right corner. Click on "Agent Studio".

    ![](/images/docs/bf83b7327d9d40a4a4c6efc7962781bfbed0af5a0c7a1bd66eaa6a4c75136d48-image.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create HTTP Action">
    Navigate to a new HTTP Action.

    ![](/images/docs/f766e3b729ab041efe71fc7f811d7086cab20363a6e32e74738aa10c75965e6f-Screenshot_2025-04-11_at_22.27.04.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Title and Description">
    Set the following title and description for your Action (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information).

    ![](/images/docs/b5c578f6ce86df1f77b7c0e8ac27a91f7926cdb4102367e0f53196c71bcb5f16-image.png)

    | Field           | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info) |
    | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Title**       | `firstname_lastname_fetch_feature_requests`                      |
    | **Description** | `Fetches a list of existing feature requests`                    |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter API Details">
    Enter the details of your API:

    1. Click on the "Import" icon to the right of the "TEST" button.

       ![](/images/docs/211a66734c7e49958b56459da201f7c13d5db1969a9aa20538baef768b0bd03d-Screenshot_2025-04-11_at_15.39.40.png)

    2. Find the **Session ID** that you created & copied from Phase 0 — you'll use it in the next step.

    3. Paste (don't click "Import" yet) the following almost-ready cURL command:

       <CodeGroup>
         ```bash bash
         curl "https://marketplace.moveworks.com/api/purple-suite/community/feature-requests?sessionId=YOUR_SESSION_ID"
         ```
       </CodeGroup>

    4. Replace `YOUR_SESSION_ID` (at the very end) in the pasted command with your actual Session ID.

    5. Click "Import" (your Action should now be auto-populated with details).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Connector">
    Add your Connector:

    1. Navigate to the "Connector" tab.

    2. Select "Inherit from existing connector".

    3. Select the Connector you created in Phase 0 (e.g. `firstname_lastname_moveworks_purple`).

       ![](/images/docs/9ac343a79e74bbc4202e15f740aaaa3ff4779b43d05e6bcc41fae5f9960a6001-image.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Action">
    Test your Action:

    1. Click on the "TEST" icon (to the right of the endpoint URL definition).

    2. Inspect the Console to verify that you receive a successful response:

       <Frame caption="You should see: Status Code 200, a list of Feature Request objects, and a response schema of the list.">
         <img src="/images/docs/d5a3fa3510a76f1a6021c0d2f553951f969b7d23377d8b88bd7bab93a74f1344-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_02.58.40.png" />
       </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish Action">
    Hit "Publish".
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  ### Nice! You've just set up 1 Action to fetch feature requests — 1 more Action to go.

  In the next section, we'll build the final Action that this Plugin requires: an Action to update the status of the feature request object in the external database.
</Check>

# Phase 1B: Set Up Your "Update Feature Request" Action

<Warning>
  ### Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment

  1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>`
     1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
  2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card
</Warning>

Now, we'll build an Action that can apply a status update to a single feature request. This Action will require two dynamic inputs (`feature_request_id` and `new_status`), and should update the feature request record in your session's database.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create HTTP Action">
    Navigate to a new HTTP Action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create">
    Click "Create".

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Title and Description">
    Set the following title and description for your Action (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information).

    | Field           | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info) |
    | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Title**       | `firstname_lastname_update_feature_request_action`               |
    | **Description** | `Updates the status of an existing feature request`              |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter API Details">
    Enter the details of your API:

    1. Click on the "Import" icon to the right of the "TEST" button.

    2. Find the same **Session ID** that you created & copied from Phase 0 — you'll use it in the next step.

    3. Paste (don't click "Import" yet) the following almost-ready cURL command:

       <CodeGroup>
         ```bash bash
         curl -X PATCH "https://marketplace.moveworks.com/api/purple-suite/community/feature-requests/{{feature_request_id}}?sessionId=YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"newStatusNumber": "{{new_status}}"}'
         ```
       </CodeGroup>

    4. Replace `YOUR_SESSION_ID` (at the very end) in the pasted command with your actual Session ID.

# Phase 2: Create a "Feature Request" Data Type & Resolver Strategy

<Warning>
  ### Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment

  1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>`
     1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
  2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card
</Warning>

To power the process of updating a feature request, creating a formal **[Data Type](/docs/data-types)** to represent a "feature request" object can help us encapsulate the properties of a feature request. Furthermore, one of the critical properties of this Data Type is that *there's a particular way to fetch values for the object*: that's what the **[Resolver Strategy](/docs/resolver-strategies)** you're also about to build will take care of!

We'll build the "feature request" Data Type with its Resolver Strategy in this phase:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Data Type">
    Navigate to a new Data Type.

    ![](/images/docs/40d2acb46048d22b5048835ae02cfead819cc1e2c12cc63d3803610c1f98d582-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_03.44.31.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Title and Description">
    Set the following title and description for your Data Type (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information). Note that the title will autofix itself to the appropriate formal type name (in `u_` prefixed format).

    | Field           | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info) |
    | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Title**       | `firstname_lastname_feature_request`                             |
    | **Description** | `A feature request object`                                       |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Schema">
    Provide the schema for an object of this type:

    1. Click "Import JSON" near the top right corner of the editor.

       ![](/images/docs/9bd3f4272eab018191125fd5aba5c5c7b0fdc41f9d203198053125bdeac4d00c-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_03.54.05.png)

    2. Paste the following JSON sample object into the popup (this will allow you to auto-generate the schema):

       <CodeGroup>
         ```bash bash
         {
           "id": "FR-12345",
           "name": "Add Dark Mode",
           "current_status": "New",
           "created_by": "[email protected]",
           "moderator": "[email protected]",
           "product_area": "UI/UX"
         }
         ```
       </CodeGroup>

    3. Click "Generate", and verify that the auto-populated schema looks correct (matches the structure of the sample object).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Resolver Strategy">
    Configure your [Resolver Strategy](/docs/resolver-strategies). This strategy will contain one [Dynamic Resolver Method](/docs/resolver-strategies#configuring-a-dynamic-resolver), which is essentially a resolver that fetches candidate options from a dynamic source (in this case, from the "fetch feature requests" HTTP Action you configured in Phase 1A).

    1. Navigate to the "Resolver Strategy" tab.

       ![](/images/docs/ea6c3d65b459957436016a2926df666cf03f28c04ac54edd80c7304b429b55eb-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_04.00.19.png)

    2. Fill out the following details for your Resolver Strategy Method:

       | Field label                                 | Value to enter/select                                                                     |

# Phase 3: Build Your Conversational Process

<Warning>
  ### Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment

  1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>`
     1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
  2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card
</Warning>

This Conversational Process, like the one in [Quickstart #1](/docs/quickstart-basic-task-agent), will also appear to be a simple single-Activity process. Its added complexity will be in the form of *two* Slots, where one of these Slots will be powered by the "feature request" Data Type you just created in Phase 2.

Here's a reminder of the bird's eye view for our Process (2 [Slots](/docs/slots), 1 [Action Activity](/docs/activities)):

![](/images/docs/c4f006437891a2bf621974a7d5c8ac7460454174c7fb11eacde106488986410c-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_04.18.39.png)

To build this Conversational Process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Conversational Process">
    Navigate to a new Conversational Process (navigate to the library and click "Create"). 
    
    ![](/images/docs/cf672292d3288b63d4346bbc1485e470afb98eefb4dbb74b1f8a410de724a806-Screenshot_2025-04-11_at_22.25.42.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Title and Description">
    Set the following title and description for your Conversational Process (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information).

    | Field           | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info)         |
    | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Title**       | `firstname_lastname_update_feature_request_process`                      |
    | **Description** | `This will help users update the status of an existing feature request.` |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Slots">
    Add TWO new **Slots** for the Process to interact with. One will represent the `feature_request` to update, and the other will be the `target_status` to set on the feature request. *📖*[Learn more about Slots](/docs/slots).

    1. Click on the "Slots" button near the top right corner of the editor.

       ![](/images/docs/66a573184d7a15edd6172d4e958100d15df2d029eb27559f307fcace224f741f-Screenshot_2025-04-11_at_22.34.38.png)

    2. Click "Create New" in the "Slots" pop up.

    3. Fill out the following details for your first `feature_request` Slot:

       | Field label                     | Value to enter/select                                                               |
       | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
       | **Name**                        | `feature_request`                                                                   |
       | **Data Type**                   | *Select the`u_FirstnameLastnameFeatureRequest` Data Type that you built in Phase 2* |
       | **Slot Description**            | `The feature request that the user wants to update.`                                |
       | **Slot Validation Policy**      | *Leave blank*                                                                       |
       | **Slot Validation Description** | *Leave blank*                                                                       |
       | **Slot Inference Policy**       | *Leave as is (Infer slot value if available)*                                       |

    4. Hit "Save" (scroll to the bottom of the popup).

    5. Click "Create New" again in the "Slots" pop up to build your second Slot.

    6. Fill out the following details for your second `target_status` Slot:

       | Field label                     | Value to enter/select                                                     |
       | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
       | **Name**                        | `target_status`                                                           |
       | **Data Type**                   | *Select "string"*                                                         |
       | **Slot Description**            | `The target status that the user wants to update the feature request to.` |
       | **Slot Validation Policy**      | *Leave blank*                                                             |
       | **Slot Validation Description** | *Leave blank*                                                             |
       | **Slot Inference Policy**       | *Leave as is (Infer slot value if available)*                             |

    7. Before saving this slot, you'll add an Inline Resolver Strategy to this `target_status` Slot. We want to power this Slot with a **[Static Resolver](/docs/resolver-strategies#configuring-a-static-resolver)** (aka a resolver which is backed by static multiple choice options).

       1. Scroll to the very bottom of this Slot creation popup and click "Add Inline Resolver Strategy".

       2. Click "+ Add Method".

       3. Fill out the following initial details for your Method.

          | Field label     | Value to enter/select                   |
          | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
          | **Method Name** | `choose_from_existing_feature_requests` |
          | **Method Type** | *Select`Static`*                        |

       4. Add the following Static Options for your Static Resolver Method. (Note: the "Raw Value" column contains the actual values that your "update feature request" HTTP Action expects in order to successfully update the status on the feature request).

          | Display Value                         | Raw Value |
          | ------------------------------------- | --------- |
          | `Existing Functionality/Native Skill` | `2`       |
          | `Limited Preview`                     | `11`      |
          | `Future Consideration`                | `3`       |
          | `Not Enough Info to Make Decision`    | `6`       |
          | `Delivered`                           | `8`       |
          | `Duplicate`                           | `9`       |
          | `New`                                 | `1`       |
          | `On Roadmap`                          | `7`       |

       5. Click the "X" in the top right corner of the "Strategy Definition" pop up.

    8. Hit "Save" (scroll to the bottom of the popup) and hit the "X" icon to close this "Slots" pop up.

# Reflecting On This Plugin

This Plugin involved a good number of core concepts in Agent Studio, with some special focus on the concept of Resolver Strategies. You've created a plugin that:

* **Fetches available feature requests** from a dynamic external source via an HTTP Action.
* **Interactively gathers details from users** to choose which feature request to update or status to update to.
* **Ensures accurate and API-compatible values** are passed to your Actions.
* **Executes for the right users at the right moments** via Triggering and Launch configurations you've set up.

Way to stick through it, and now your Plugin is ready to enable users to seamlessly keep their feature requests up to date!
