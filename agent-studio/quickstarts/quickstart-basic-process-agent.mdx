# Learning Objectives

This Quickstart guide will walk you through the steps of creating a Process Agent to **help users navigate submitting purchase requests**. In this guide, you'll get to see a few concepts in action as you learn how to:

* Leverage a [Decision Policy](/docs/control-flow) to control branching logic in a Conversational Process.
* Use multiple types of [Activities](/docs/activities) in a Conversational Process to handle different tasks.
* Design a Plugin that involves more [Slots](/docs/slots) (with simple [Validation Policies](/docs/slots#slot-validation-policy)).

# Prerequisites

1. Access to the "Agent Studio" App.
2. Completed [Quickstart #1: Basic Task Agent](/docs/quickstart-basic-task-agent).

# What you'll build

Today, we will be building a Purchase Request (PR) Submission Process Agent. This Agent will ask the end user details about the particular PR they want to submit, compare the details against historical PRs, and either submit it if it can be labeled as "OpEx" or reject it if it's considered "CapEx".

Here is an example of the **end-user experience** we hope to enable:

In order to build this, here's one way to decompose the process into a **Conversational Process**, consisting of a few *Activities* (both Action-based and Content-based), a *Decision Policy*, and a few *Slots* to power the data needed in this process:

![](/images/docs/0c32f7796223116002c5711b2d2e7a2243e66e4b400c40f92078e2b071155526-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_16.24.19.png)

In this guide, you'll work your way through these main phases:

1. Set up **2 (HTTP)[Actions](/docs/actions)**: one to fetch historical PRs, and another to Submit a PR.
2. Build the **Conversational Process**, complete with 4 Slots, 5 different Activities, 1 Decision Policy, as illustrated above.
3. Add the Conversational Process to your AI Agent by launching a Plugin.

*Let's get started!*

# Phase 0: Generate a unique Session ID & Set up your Connector

<Warning>
  ### Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment

  1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>`
     1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
  2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card
</Warning>

<Info>
  ### You may be able to skip this phase if you've completed another Agent Studio Quickstart guide.

  *You can skip Phase 0 and move onto Phase 1A if:*

  1. You have already created a `firstname_lastname_moveworks_purple` connector, AND
  2. You already have your unique "Session ID" on hand.

  This section will walk you through how to set up your own connector to the Moveworks Purple API (which powers the Actions used in the Quickstart guides), so no need to repeat this step if you've done it before.
</Info>

In this guide, you'll build a Plugin that will actually fetch from and take action on a store of feature requests that's **set up just for you**. In preparation for this, follow these steps

1. Go to the [Moveworks Purple API Tool](purple-api-tool).
2. Click "Create New Session ID". You should see sample feature requests populate below.
3. Copy your **Session ID** to your own notes. You'll to have this on hand in the following phase when we set up your Actions.

Now, you just need to set up a (reusable) connector that will allow you to seamlessly hit the necessary Actions that your Plugin will use.

1. Navigate to the App Picker in the top right corner of Agent Studio.

2. Click on "HTTP Connectors", which will take you to another browser tab.

3. Click "Create" in the top right corner.

4. Fill out the following information for your Connector (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information).

   | Field               | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info) |
   | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Connection Name** | `firstname_lastname_moveworks_purple`                            |
   | **Description**     | `Moveworks Purple APIs Connector`                                |
   | **Base Url**        | `https://marketplace.moveworks.com`                              |
   | **Auth Config**     | `No Auth`                                                        |

5. Click "Save" on the bottom right corner.

# Phase 1A: Set up your "Get Historical Purchases" Action

<Warning>
  ### Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment

  1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>`
     1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
  2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card
</Warning>

Let's first set up an [HTTP Action](/docs/http-actions) that will retrieve historical PRs. This Action doesn't require any dynamic inputs, and will just query an external system for a list of purchase requests.

1. Navigate to the App Picker in the top right corner. Click on "Agent Studio".

   ![](/images/docs/438f1d36c6c956eb17f6e93d3ca28966a783e67a75a8e1dddcd741594258a4f8-CleanShot_2025-04-14_at_08.48.272x.png)

2. Navigate to a new HTTP Action.

   ![](/images/docs/f766e3b729ab041efe71fc7f811d7086cab20363a6e32e74738aa10c75965e6f-Screenshot_2025-04-11_at_22.27.04.png)

3. Set the following title and description for your Action (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information).

   | Field           | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info) |
   | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Title**       | `firstname_lastname_get_historical_purchases`                    |
   | **Description** | `Fetches a list of historical purchase requests`                 |

4. Enter the details of your API:

   1. Click on the "Import" icon to the right of the "TEST" button.

      ![](/images/docs/211a66734c7e49958b56459da201f7c13d5db1969a9aa20538baef768b0bd03d-Screenshot_2025-04-11_at_15.39.40.png)

   2. Paste the following cURL command:

      <CodeGroup>
        ```bash bash
        curl "https://marketplace.moveworks.com/api/purple-suite/erp/purchase-requests/history"
        ```
      </CodeGroup>

   3. Click "Import" (your Action should now be auto-populated with details).

5. Navigate to the "Connector" tab, and select your existing Moveworks Purple Connector (set up in Phase 0).

   ![](/images/docs/1cb57a734bacebaf642886e3960a0cf0eab133646ab10288e2e85317dffd513d-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_02.48.16.png)

6. Test your Action:

   1. Click on the "TEST" icon (to the right of the endpoint URL definition).

   2. Inspect the Console to verify that you receive a successful response:

      <Frame caption="You should see: Status Code 200, a list of Purchase Request objects, and a response schema of the list.">
        <img src="/images/docs/4fc1ade462018ae2d7c21fe1c60dfec6da1964fa17b5901337fbf1f52f5f6bf6-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_16.56.14.png" />
      </Frame>

7. Hit "Publish".

<Check>
  ### You've just set up 1 out of 2 custom Actions needed for this process!

  This Action will fetch the critical history of past purchase requests (that later you'll compare a user's new request against). Next up: setting up an action to actually submit new purchase requests.
</Check>

# Phase 1B: Set up your "Submit Purchase Request" Action

<Warning>
  ### Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment

  1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>`
     1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
  2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card
</Warning>

The next (and final) Action to set up will add a new purchase request object (and will actually update the purchase record database in your personal session!). This Action will require three dynamic inputs: `item_name`, `quantity`, and `justification`.

1. Navigate to a new HTTP Action.

2. Set the following title and description for your Action (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information).

   | Field           | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info) |
   | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Title**       | `firstname_lastname_submit_purchase_request`                     |
   | **Description** | `Submits a new purchase request to Procurement`                  |

3. Enter the details of your API:

   1. Click on the import button to the right of the "TEST" button.

      ![](/images/docs/211a66734c7e49958b56459da201f7c13d5db1969a9aa20538baef768b0bd03d-Screenshot_2025-04-11_at_15.39.40.png)

   2. Find the same **Session ID** that you created & copied from Phase 0 — you'll use it in the next step.

   3. Paste (don't click "Import" yet) the following almost-ready cURL command:

      <CodeGroup>
        ```bash bash
        curl -X POST "https://marketplace.moveworks.com/api/purple-suite/erp/purchase-requests" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
            "sessionId": "YOUR_SESSION_ID",
            "purchase_request": {
              "item_name": "{{item_name}}",
              "quantity": "{{quantity}}",
              "business_justification": "{{justification}}",
              "amount": 1200.00
            }
        }'
        ```
      </CodeGroup>

   4. Replace `YOUR_SESSION_ID` (*scroll all the way to the right to find it at the end of the URL*) in the pasted command with your actual Session ID.

   5. Click "Import" (your Action should now be auto-populated with details).

4. Navigate to the "Connector" tab, and select your existing Moveworks Purple Connector (set up in Phase 0).

      | **Confirmation Policy**                     | *Check the "Require consent from the user" box*                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

6. Build your first **Decision Policy**, which will execute after the already configured 2 Activity blocks. This policy will allow the Process to branch its execution depending on the `pr_classification` returned by the generate text Action Activity. 📖 *[Learn more about Decision Policies](/docs/control-flow).*

   1. Click on the "+" square icon below the second generate text Activity in the main section of the Conversational Process Editor.

   2. Click on "Decision Policy". (No need to input anything in the panel that appears on the right).

      ![](/images/docs/bf9dab05124baa8593de3230dfe9d7ff2110945f6dd8d05dc1d2b4dc37cb9b7c-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_18.31.00.png)

   3. Increment the number of Cases by clicking on the "+" button to the right of the words "1 case".

      ![](/images/docs/bc0023b28981318b05ea335ac03acbba9209a9daabf646aaaed8be8ee94bb452-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_18.32.32.png)

   4. Click on the *first* Case entry under the Decision Policy and enter the below DSL rule in the panel that appears on the right:

      ![](/images/docs/f4ea9279552fe304dfa0f0dbd31d0be2ad1e8cb342adcea5d2b196799f2f3708-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_18.35.31.png)

      <CodeGroup>
        ```bash bash
        data.pr_classification.$LOWERCASE() == "opex"
        ```
      </CodeGroup>

   5. Click on the *second* Case entry under the Decision Policy and enter the below DSL rule in the panel that appears on the right:

      ![](/images/docs/d5c539a7ff47cd8595735e70c743975df554da62e5f7162f7a2df3ccf08168e2-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_18.38.57.png)

      ```
      data.pr_classification.$LOWERCASE() == "capex"
      ```

7. Create the Action Activity that will execute under the *first* Decision Policy Case (`pr_classification` is `opex`).

   1. Click on the "+" icon below the *first* Case entry under the Decision Policy.

      ![](/images/docs/3bcd2ff69cd038d21f86d26af855592e895efc9537ee87245fd97be2ec220376-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_18.41.40.png)

   2. Select "Action Activity".

   3. Fill out the following details for your Action Activity, which will connect your slots to the input(s) of the HTTP Action (and mapping the result of the Action back to the Conversational Process).

      | Field label                                 | Value to enter/select                                                                                                      |
      | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
      | **Action**                                  | \*Select the`firstname_lastname_submit_purchase_request` Action that you built in Phase 1B \*                              |
      | **Required Slots**                          | *Select all 4 Slots:`item_name`, `quantity`, `business_justification`, and `is_purchase_for_organization_acknowledgement`* |
      | **Input mapping** (3 fields mapped)         | `item_name: data.item_name` `justification: data.business_justification` `quantity: data.quantity`                         |
      | **Output Mapping** (".dot\_walk\_here" box) | *Leave blank (output is fine as is)*                                                                                       |
      | **Output Key**                              | `submitted_pr_result`                                                                                                      |
      | **Confirmation Policy**                     | *Check the "Require consent from the user" box*                                                                            |

      1. Note that even though `is_purchase_for_organization_acknowledgement` is not technically needed to invoke the submit pr action, marking it as a required Slot for this Activity ensures that the AI Agent will ensure it fills the Slot before executing this Activity.

8. Create the Content Activity that will execute under the *second* Decision Policy Case (`pr_classification` is `capex`).

   1. Click on the "+" icon below the *second* Case entry under the Decision Policy.

   2. Select "Content Activity" this time.

      ![](/images/docs/d49b0d9da342e99e38b4e09207f808adf307fbee690d3e6a9b5bbd9d14417a9c-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_18.54.18.png)

   3. Keep the "Content Type" set to "Text".

   4. Paste the following text content (which will share text instructions with the user on how to submit purchase requests that fall under CapEx).

      <CodeGroup>
        ```bash bash
        This request falls under CapEx. Please visit <a href="https://www.google.com">CapEx Submission Portal</a> to submit your request.
        ```
      </CodeGroup>

9. Create the Content Activity that will execute under the `default` branch (when `pr_classification` somehow is neither `opex` nor `capex`).

   1. Click on the "+" icon below the *second* Case entry under the Decision Policy.
   2. Select "Content Activity" again.
   3. Keep the "Content Type" set to "Text".
   4. Paste the following text content (which will share text instructions with the user on how to submit purchase requests that fall under CapEx).
      <CodeGroup>
        ```bash bash
        Unfortunately, this purchase request could not get categorized, so it was not submitted. Please feel free to try submitting another request.
        ```
      </CodeGroup>

10. Click "Validate". If everything went well so far, the Console (bottom of the editor) will say "Validation successful".

    1. 💡Pro-tip: You can also use the following hotkeys to validate without pressing the button:

       | On a MacOS machine | On a Windows machine |
       | ------------------ | -------------------- |
       | Cmd + Shift + V    | Ctrl + Shift + V     |

11. Click "Publish", review details, and Click "Publish" once again.

# Reflecting on this Plugin

The Plugin you just built contains a plethora of Agent Studio concepts, from different Activity types to Decision Policies. There's a lot it had to take care of as a Process Agent:

* **Retrieve historical purchases** from an external source.
* **Perform classification on the fly** to figure out how to categorize the user's intended purchase.
* **Make an informed decision** on the best way to support the request, depending on the predicted classification.
* **Collect critical information** that's needed for submitting a purchase request.
* **Executes for the right users at the right moments** via Triggering and Launch configurations you've set up.

Congratulations on building this powerful Process Agent — it's now ready to help support users with their procurement purchase needs!
