# Background

Before getting started, here are some terms and concepts to get you up to speed.

## What is an Agent?

Agents are AI-powered digital workers who can understand natural language requests, reason through complex problems, and act on users' behalf across your organization's systems. Unlike traditional automation tools, agents combine the power of large language models with secure system access to create truly intelligent automations.

### Types of Agents

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Task Agents" icon="check-circle">
    Task Agents are designed to handle specific, well-defined tasks that typically involve a single request and response cycle. They excel at executing discrete actions like checking statuses, submitting tickets, or retrieving information. Task Agents are perfect for automating routine operations that previously required manual intervention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Process Agents" icon="sitemap">
    Process Agents manage multi-step workflows that span across different systems and may require sequential actions. These agents can coordinate complex business processes that involve decision points, conditional logic, and multiple backend systems. Process Agents are ideal for automating end-to-end workflows like employee onboarding or change management processes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Proactive Agents" icon="bell">
    Proactive Agents monitor systems and data to initiate actions without explicit user requests. They can detect patterns, anticipate needs, and take preemptive steps to address potential issues before they impact operations. These agents provide value through timely interventions based on predefined triggers and conditions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ambient Agents" icon="cloud">
    Ambient Agents work continuously in the background, learning from interactions and improving over time. They build a contextual understanding of your organization's operations and can offer insights or assistance based on observed patterns. Ambient Agents enhance the overall intelligence of your automation ecosystem.

## Agent Studio Overview

Agent Studio is a comprehensive environment where you can discover, create, deploy, and monitor AI agents throughout their lifecycle. It provides an intuitive interface for developers and business users to collaborate on agent creation without deep AI expertise. The studio offers templates, testing tools, and analytics to streamline the development process.

## What is a Plugin?

Plugins are the building blocks that give agents their capabilities. Each Plugin represents a specific function or integration that can be added to an agent, allowing it to perform certain actions or access particular systems. Plugins become powerful AI agents when deployed in your AI Assistant, enabling seamless automation across your digital landscape.

A Plugin in the new Plugin Workspace is comprised of 3 key components:

1. **A Trigger.** Defines the situations under which the AI agent should execute a Plugin.
2. **A Launch Configuration.** Specifies which end users should have access to a Plugin.
3. **A Process.** Contains the actual execution logic of the Plugin.

In this guide, we'll be building a Plugin that is triggered conversationally and runs a *Conversational* Process. A Conversational Process contains the definitions of data that a Plugin needs & the steps executed by a Plugin.

**Triggers** and **Launch Configurations** are existing concepts but the **Conversational Process** is new.

📖 *[Learn more about Triggers](natural-language-triggers)* 📖 *[Learn more about Launch Configurations](launch-configuration)* 📖 *[Learn more about Conversational Processes](/docs/plugin-process)*

*What exactly goes into a Conversational Process?*

A Conversational Process houses the logic that defines what a Plugin actually does. There are several key building blocks involved in a Process: **Activities** (key steps to execute throughout the process), **Decision Policies** (controls when to run certain activities), and **Slots** (values that the process needs to make decisions and execute activities).

1. **Activities.** Key steps to perform throughout the process. For example, an Activity can involve taking action in some external system, or sharing a piece of configured content back to the end user.

2. **Decision Policies.** Represent decision points in a process, which can control when to run certain Activities.

3. **Slots**. Values that the process needs in order to effectively execute. For example, Slots may be required in order to execute Activities and make Decisions. There are a few interesting properties of Slots that we can leverage, for example:

   1. **Input Validator**. Ensures that a Slot value meets a certain condition (via DSL rule).
   2. **Slot Inference Policy**. Specifies whether an AI Agent can automatically infer a value for the slot.
   3. **Resolver Strategy**. Determines how an AI agent can get a value for the Slot. For example, a Resolver can help resolve natural language values to API values that a Process will need to use.

***

# What You'll Build

The objective of the Plugin you're about to build is to allow an employee to get their PTO (Paid Time Off) balance. (This would fall under the category of **Task Agents**).

Before starting to build, we always recommend that you first map out the desired **end user experience** and the overall **building blocks of the Conversational Process**.

Here is an example of the **end-user experience** we hope to enable:

To get to this experience, the **Conversational Process** should consist of one *Activity* (powered by an HTTP Action) and one user email *Slot* required in order to run the Activity:

<Frame caption="Note: This single-Activity Process does not require any Decision Policies.">

</Check>

# Phase 2: Build Your Conversational Process

<Warning>
  ### Important building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment

  1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>`
     1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
  2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card
</Warning>

You will now leverage the action you just created to retrieve your user's PTO balance. (Conversational processes will often involve multiple actions, but we'll keep it simple for this use case).

In this phase, you'll 1) build a `user_email` **[Slot](/docs/slots)**, and 2) an **[Action Activity](/docs/activities)** to fetch PTO balance (which requires the user email Slot as input). Here's a reminder of the bird's-eye view for our Process.
