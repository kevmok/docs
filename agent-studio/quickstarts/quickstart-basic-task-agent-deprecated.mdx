Whether you're looking to streamline IT support, enhance customer service, or optimize internal workflows, Agent Studio gives you the tools to build intelligent solutions that address your specific business challenges.

This guide teaches you how to build your first Task Agent -- just one of the many intelligent agents you can create with our platform. You'll discover how Plugins extend your agent's capabilities, how to configure slots for gathering information, how to set up launch rules, and how to implement triggering mechanisms that make your agent responsive to user needs.

# Learning Objectives

This Quickstart guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on how to build a simple Task Agent that will **allow a user to easily check their PTO (Paid Time Off) balance**. As part of the building process you'll learn how to:

* Set up and test HTTP Actions.
* Configure Conversational Processes.
* Understand and set up Slots.

# Prerequisites

1. Access to "Agent Studio" App.
2. Basic understanding of [Actions](actions).

***

# Background

Before getting started, here are some terms and concepts to get you up to speed.

## What is an Agent?

Agents are AI-powered digital workers who can understand natural language requests, reason through complex problems, and act on users' behalf across your organization's systems. Unlike traditional automation tools, agents combine the power of large language models with secure system access to create truly intelligent automations.

### Types of Agents

#### Task Agents

Task Agents are designed to handle specific, well-defined tasks that typically involve a single request and response cycle. They excel at executing discrete actions like checking statuses, submitting tickets, or retrieving information. Task Agents are perfect for automating routine operations that previously required manual intervention.

#### Process Agents

Process Agents manage multi-step workflows that span across different systems and may require sequential actions. These agents can coordinate complex business processes that involve decision points, conditional logic, and multiple backend systems. Process Agents are ideal for automating end-to-end workflows like employee onboarding or change management processes.

#### Proactive Agents

Proactive Agents monitor systems and data to initiate actions without explicit user requests. They can detect patterns, anticipate needs, and take preemptive steps to address potential issues before they impact operations. These agents provide value through timely interventions based on predefined triggers and conditions.

#### Ambient Agents

Ambient Agents work continuously in the background, learning from interactions and improving over time. They build a contextual understanding of your organization's operations and can offer insights or assistance based on observed patterns. Ambient Agents enhance the overall intelligence of your automation ecosystem.

## Agent Studio Overview

Agent Studio is a comprehensive environment where you can discover, create, deploy, and monitor AI agents throughout their lifecycle. It provides an intuitive interface for developers and business users to collaborate on agent creation without deep AI expertise. The studio offers templates, testing tools, and analytics to streamline the development process.

## What is a Plugin?

Plugins are the building blocks that give agents their capabilities. Each Plugin represents a specific function or integration that can be added to an agent, allowing it to perform certain actions or access particular systems. Plugins become powerful AI agents when deployed in your AI Assistant, enabling seamless automation across your digital landscape.

A Plugin in the new Plugin Workspace is comprised of 3 key components:

1. **A Trigger.** Defines the situations under which the AI agent should execute a Plugin.
2. **A Launch Configuration.** Specifies which end users should have access to a Plugin.
3. **A Process.** Contains the actual execution logic of the Plugin. 

In this guide, we'll be building a Plugin that is triggered conversationally and runs a *Conversational* Process. A Conversational Process contains the definitions of data that a Plugin needs & the steps executed by a Plugin.

**Triggers** and **Launch Configurations** are existing concepts but the **Conversational Process** is new. 

📖 *[Learn more about Triggers](natural-language-triggers)*\
📖 *[Learn more about Launch Configurations](launch-configuration)*\
:book: *[Learn more about Conversational Processes](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/plugin-process)*

*What exactly goes into a Conversational Process?*

A Conversational Process houses the logic that defines what a Plugin actually does. There are several key building blocks involved in a Process: **Activities** (key steps to execute throughout the process), **Decision Policies** (controls when to run certain activities), and **Slots** (values that the process needs to make decisions and execute activities).

1. **Activities.** Key steps to perform throughout the process. For example, an Activity can involve taking action in some external system, or sharing a piece of configured content back to the end user.
2. **Decision Policies.** Represent decision points in a process, which can control when to run certain Activities.
3. **Slots**. Values that the process needs in order to effectively execute. For example, Slots may be required in order to execute Activities and make Decisions. There are a few interesting properties of Slots that we can leverage, for example:
   1. **Input Validator**. Ensures that a Slot value meets a certain condition (via DSL rule).
   2. **Slot Inference Policy**. Specifies whether an AI Agent can automatically infer a value for the slot.
   3. **Resolver Strategy**. Determines how an AI agent can get a value for the Slot. For example, a Resolver can help resolve natural language values to API values that a Process will need to use.

***

# What You'll Build

The objective of the Plugin you're about to build is to allow an employee to get their PTO (Paid Time Off) balance. (This would fall under the category of **Task Agents**).

Before starting to build, we always recommend that you first map out the desired **end user experience** and the overall **building blocks of the Conversational Process**.

Here is an example of the **end-user experience** we hope to enable:

<Image align="center" width="800px" src="https://files.readme.io/9750cc52a12c712943b10e8642e78eb14c1cc63f4e9a604fe56dd6898b2dc43b-CleanShot_2025-04-09_at_14.57.26.png" />

To get to this experience, the **Conversational Process** should consist of one *Activity* (powered by an HTTP Action) and one user email *Slot* required in order to run the Activity:

<Image alt="Note: this single-Activity Process does not require any Decision Policies." align="center" width="60% " src="https://files.readme.io/f9562f73488d0198b2a309bd36d0f1aa0afd065559a197c956b2ecd2ea58c77c-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_02.09.18.png">
  Note: this single-Activity Process does not require any Decision Policies.
</Image>

You'll build an end-to-end working Plugin via these phases: 

1. Set up an  **Action (HTTP Action)**.
2. Build the **Conversational Process**, containing the 1 Activity (using the Action set up in the previous phase) and the 1 Slot, as illustrated above.
3. Add the Conversational Process to your AI Agent by launching a **Plugin**.

*Let's get started!*

# Phase 0: Generate a Unique Session ID & Set Up Your Connector

> ❗️ Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment
>
> 1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>` 
>    1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
> 2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card

> 👀 You may be able to skip this phase if you've completed another Agent Studio Quickstart guide.
>
> *You can skip this phase if:*
>
> 1. You have already created a `firstname_lastname_moveworks_purple` connector.
>
> This section will walk you through how to set up your own connector to the Moveworks Purple API (which powers the Actions used in the Quickstart guides), so no need to repeat this step if you've done it before.

In this guide, the PTO data that your Action will access lives behind the Moveworks Purple API Connector. To access this data via your Action, you need to set up a (reusable) connector:

1. Navigate to the App Picker in the top right corner of Agent Studio.
2. Click on "HTTP Connectors", which will take you to another browser tab.

   <Image align="center" width="300px" src="https://files.readme.io/eac1a5fcfe10b386a1f5cbadfefbfe55b6fafe24491c492b176bcc107a674470-CleanShot_2025-04-12_at_12.06.49.png" />
3. Click "Create" in the top right corner.
4. Fill out the following information for your Connector (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information).

   | Field               | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info)  |
   | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Connection Name** | `firstname_lastname_moveworks_purple`                             |
   | **Description**     | `Moveworks Purple APIs Connector`                                 |
   | **Base Url**        | `https://us-central1-creator-studio-workflows.cloudfunctions.net` |
   | **Auth Config**     | `No Auth`                                                         |
5. Click "Save" on the bottom right corner.

> 👍 You're now fully ready to start building. On to Phase 1!

# Phase 1: Set Up Your Action (Get PTO Balance)

> ❗️ Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment
>
> 1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>` 
>    1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
> 2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card

We'll start by creating an [HTTP Action](http-actions) that can query an external system for a user's PTO balance.

1. Navigate to the App Picker in the top right corner. Click on "Agent Studio".

   <Image align="center" width="300px" src="https://files.readme.io/8a1d6d41f2431631dcb80e0736ffd9ec0bb31418100bc79463170fe7840cba2d-CleanShot_2025-04-14_at_08.48.272x.png" />

7. Define a formal input argument to represent the "user email" input this Action requires:

   1. Click on the "Input Args" button near the top right corner.

      <Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/81413c52f88eaf2d5bf6364e688d70073a439352a96775e458ca60d91a326842-Screenshot_2025-04-11_at_15.40.07.png" />
   2. Click "Create New" in the Input Arguments pop up.
   3. Fill out the following details for your input argument:

      | Field label       | Value to enter/select                                    |
      | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
      | **Argument Name** | `user_email`                                             |
      | **Data Type**     | *Select "string"*                                        |
      | **Example Value** | `test_email@example.com`                                 |
      | **Description**   | `The email address of the user to fetch PTO balance for` |
      | **Required**      | *Check the box*                                          |
   4. Hit "Save" and hit the "X" icon to close this "Input Arguments" pop up.
8. Test your Action:

   1. Click on the "TEST" icon (to the right of the endpoint URL definition).
   2. Inspect the Console to verify that you receive a successful response:

      <Image alt="You should see: Status Code 200, a PTO result object, and a response schema of the returned object." align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/b123ac83f5b78ce76be856a9ea9f516b53a654696bbd60684284a6e05e329ddc-Screenshot_2025-04-11_at_15.26.49.png">
        You should see: Status Code 200, a PTO result object, and a response schema of the returned object.
      </Image>
9. Click "Publish". Review details, and click "Publish" once again.

> 👍 Congratulations! You've set up your first Action.
>
> You should see your Action marked as "Published" in the HTTP Action library. In the next phase, you'll use this Action in a **Conversational Process**, as part of the main Action Activity in that process.

# Phase 2: Build Your Conversational Process

> ❗️ Import building notes if you are using the Moveworks Developer Labs environment
>
> 1. If you are working in a Moveworks lab environment, name anything you save (Plugin, Action, Data Type, etc.) with `<fullname>_<descriptive_name>` 
>    1. For example: `lucasrollo_Submit_PTO_Action`
> 2. When launching your Plugin, make sure to only launch to yourself! You can do this by going to Your Plugin > Launch Configuration > Allow Selected Users > the email on your credential card

You will now leverage the action you just created to retrieve your user's PTO balance. (Conversational processes will often involve multiple actions, but we'll keep it simple for this use case).

In this phase, you'll 1) build a `user_email` **[Slot](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/slots)**, and 2) an **[Action Activity](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/activities)** to fetch PTO balance (which requires the user email Slot as input). Here's a reminder of the bird's-eye view for our Process.

<Image align="center" width="50% " src="https://files.readme.io/f0d78b166c14e9518feaa191ceb8d2f1ceaa3254b10f563b1a888e18676d5b62-Screenshot_2025-04-12_at_02.09.18.png" />

2. Set the following title and description for your Conversational Process (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information).

   | Field           | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info) |
   | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Title**       | `firstname_lastname_get_mw_pto_balance_process`                  |
   | **Description** | `Fetches the PTO balance for a given user`                       |
3. Add a new **Slot** to represent the user email that this process will need to collect. 📖 *[Learn more about Slots](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/slots)*.
