# 3. Your Build Path

1. **[Quickstart #5: Notification Ambient Agent](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/webhook-triggers-quickstart-guide#/)**
   1. Build a simple webhook → notify flow with one actionable button.

2. Optionally, you can continue with the quickstart guides to build your knowledge:

   1. **[Quickstart #6: Expense Approval Ambient Agent](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/quickstart-6-expense-approval-ambient-agent#/)**
      1. Add buttons, capture input, and complete an approval loop.
   2. **[Quickstart #7: Scheduled Trigger Ambient Agent](/docs/quickstart-7-scheduled-trigger-ambient-agent#/)**
      1. Build simple and powerful analysis notifications

3. **Build your own Ambient Agent use case.** *Examples to consider:*

   1. IT: auto-triage high-priority tickets; notify owners with “Approve / Assign / Snooze”
   2. Finance: expense policy check + flag high-risk line items for review
   3. HR: open-enrollment reminders with “Enroll / Ask a question” Tips:
