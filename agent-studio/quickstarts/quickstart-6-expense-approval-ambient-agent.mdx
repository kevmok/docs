# Learning Objectives

This guide will walk you through creating an Ambient Agent that intelligently handles expense approval requests. By listening to a webhook from your expense management system, this agent can differentiate between low-value and high-value expenses. It will automatically approve smaller expenses and route larger ones to the appropriate manager for manual review. By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

* **Configure a Listener**.
* **Build a Compound Action** that uses conditional logic based on the expense amount.
* **Implement an automated approval branch** for expenses under a set threshold.
* **Create a manual approval branch** that identifies the correct approver and sends them an interactive approval request.
* **Update the source system** to reflect the final "approved" or "rejected" status.

# Prerequisites

1. Access to the "Agent Studio" App
2. Completed [Quickstart #5: Notification Ambient Agent](/docs/webhook-triggers-quickstart-guide#/)

# What You'll Build

In this guide, you'll build an Expense Approval Ambient Agent that acts as a smart filter for your company's expense workflow. This agent will differentiate between low- and high-value expenses, automatically approving any report under $500 while routing larger sums to the appropriate manager for manual review. This automates routine tasks and ensures high-value expenses get the necessary oversight.

The result is a streamlined process for everyone. For expenses over $500, managers receive a simple, direct approval request right in their chat client, allowing them to take action in seconds.

![](/images/docs/b376e7953688525d56f5e7d8417ef310d518b37f65cbc3e159e8a4764b1b05ef-CleanShot_2025-09-04_at_22.13.38.png)

While the user-facing interaction is intentionally simple, the real power is the automation happening behind the scenes. The agent processes every request from your expense system, and for the majority of expenses (those under $500), no manual action is needed at all, they are approved instantly.

To achieve this, you will construct the workflow shown below. The agent's logic is built around a central Compound Action that is triggered by a Listener. This Compound Action ingests data from the expense system, such as the approver, the requester, and the expense details, and then follows a conditional path based on the expense amount.

![](/images/docs/192481a5388104a90d7c228003a5cf9057654a6fbb18ea0275f34b870485a550-image.png)

You'll build an end-to-end working Ambient Agent Plugin via these phases:

1. Set up a **Listener**
2. Build the **Compound Action**
3. Add the Listener and Compound Action to your AI Agent by launching a **Plugin**
4. Test the approval workflow using the Purple Suite testing tool.

*Let's get started!*

# Phase 0: Generate a unique Session ID & Set up your Connector

<Info>
  ### You may be able to skip this phase if you've completed another Agent Studio Quickstart guide.

  *You can skip Phase 0 and move onto Phase 1 if:*

  1. You have already created a `first_last_moveworks_purple` connector, AND
  2. You already have your unique "Session ID" on hand.

  This section will walk you through how to set up your own connector to the Moveworks Purple API (which powers the Actions used in the Quickstart guides), so no need to repeat this step if you've done it before.
</Info>

In this guide, you'll build a Plugin that will actually fetch from and take action on a store of feature requests that's **set up just for you**. In preparation for this, follow these steps

1. Go to the [Moveworks Purple API Tool](purple-api-tool).
2. Click "Create New Session ID". You should see sample feature requests populate below.
3. Do not close the Purple API Tool

Now, you just need to set up a (reusable) connector that will allow you to seamlessly hit the necessary Actions that your Plugin will use.

1. Navigate to the App Picker in the top right corner of Agent Studio.

2. Click on "HTTP Connectors", which will take you to another browser tab.

3. Click "Create" in the top right corner.

4. Fill out the following information for your Connector (be sure to replace "first" and "last" with your corresponding information).

   | Field                              | Value to enter (replace "firstname" & "lastname" with your info) |
   | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Connection Name**                | `first_last_moveworks_purple`                                    |
   | **Description**                    | `Moveworks Purple APIs Connector`                                |
   | **Display Description (Optional)** | *leave blank*                                                    |
   | **Base Url**                       | `https://marketplace.moveworks.com`                              |
   | **Auth Config**                    | `No Auth`                                                        |

5. Click "Save" on the bottom right corner.

# Phase 3: Create Your Compound Action

You will now create a compound action to handle the incoming webhook routed by the listener.

In this phase you will build a compound action with 1) `approver`, `business_justification`, `requested_by`, `payload`, `session_id` as input arguments, 2) three actions to resolve the users by email, create a Moveworks approval request, and update the approval in the source system, and 3) switch expressions to conditionally route the expense approval requests. Here's a reminder of the bird's-eye view for our Compound Action:

2. Set the following title and description for your Compound Action (be sure to replace "firstname" and "lastname" with your corresponding information).

   | Field           | Value                                          |
   | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
   | **Title**       | `quickstart_first_last_expense_approval_ca`    |
   | **Description** | `Handles an incoming expense approval request` |

3. Copy the following expression into the Compound Action Editor

     **Understanding the Compound Action (Guide #6)**

     This Compound Action routes an expense-approval flow. It can **early-approve** low-risk requests, then (for everything else) **fetches users**, **summarizes the request with an LLM**, **creates an approval**, and finally **updates the source system** based on the approver’s decision.

     1. `switch` (early decision) **[(Syntax)](/docs/compound-action-syntax-reference#/switch)**

        1. **Purpose:** Short-circuit the workflow for small requests.
        2. **Process:** If `data.payload.amount < 500`, call your custom action `quickstart_first_last_update_approval_request` to **approve** immediately, then `return` with an `early_return_message` and stop the flow.
        3. Otherwise, fall through to the default branch (do nothing here) and continue.

     2. mw\.batch\_get\_users\_by\_email\` **[(Built-in Action)](/docs/built-in-actions#/batch_get_users_by_email)**

        1. **Purpose:** Resolve both the approver and the requester to Moveworks user objects.
        2. **Inputs:** `user_emails: [data.approver, data.requested_by]` (provided by your trigger mapping).
        3. **Output:** `data.target_users.user_records[0].user` (approver) and `[1].user` (requester).

     3. `mw.generate_text_action` **[(Built-in Action)](/docs/built-in-actions#/generate_text_action)**

        1. **Purpose:** Create a crisp summary for the approver.

        2. **Process:**

           1. `system_prompt` asks the LLM to produce an approver-ready summary.
           2. user\_input`uses`RENDER()`to pass both the **business justification** and the **raw webhook payload** (stringified via`$STRINGIFY\_JSON(data.payload)\`).

        3. **Output:** `data.llm_summary_result.generated_output` (the formatted approval details).

     4. `mw.create_generic_approval_request` **[(Built-in Action)](/docs/built-in-actions#/create_generic_approval_request)**

        1. **Purpose:** Open an approval with the resolved participants and LLM summary.

        2. **Inputs:**

           1. `approvers`: `[ data.target_users.user_records[0].user ]`
           2. `users_requested_for`: `[ data.target_users.user_records[1].user ]`
           3. `approval_details`: `data.llm_summary_result.generated_output`

        3. **Output:** `data.approval_request_result.status` indicates if the approver **Approved** or **Denied**.

     5. `switch` (post-decision update) **[(Syntax)](/docs/compound-action-syntax-reference#/switch)**

        1. **Purpose:** Sync the final decision back to your source system.

           1. **Process:**
              1. If `data.approval_request_result.status == "DENIED"`, call your custom action `quickstart_first_last_update_approval_request` with `status: 'denied'`.

           2. **Default:** Call the same custom action with `status: 'approved'`.

           3. **Inputs to custom action:**

              1. `approval_id: data.payload.approval_id` (from the incoming webhook),
              2. `status: 'approved' | 'denied'`,
              3. `session_id: data.session_id` (used for request scoping/traceability).

  ### All done with Actions!

  You're ready to move on — time to create your Plugin and put everything you've built together.
</Check>

# Phase 4: Configure and Launch Your Plugin

This section guides you through adding your Listener and Compound Action to a **Plugin**. A key step will be configuring the data flow, where you'll specify exactly which fields from the webhook you want to forward to your action.

1. Navigate to a new Plugin (navigate to the library and click "Create").

   ![](/images/docs/3dc80b34aa167ed521edb3b70f28538db7528fd1c94ac3b498aa1420d741cf27-image.png)

2. Set the following title and description for your Plugin (be sure to replace "first" and "last" with your corresponding information).

   | Field           | Value to enter                                  |
   | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
   | **Title**       | `quickstart_first_last_expense_approval`        |
   | **Description** | `Handles an incoming expense approval request.` |

3. In the “Workflow Overview” section click “System” in the Trigger box.

   ![](/images/docs/acda56803fb61470e49986e7c50a9ed4f2187cbccda21f9934ca90ed5c3d9028-CleanShot_2025-09-02_at_09.35.41.png)

   1. Configure your system trigger to connect your Listener in the slide-out pop up with:

      | Field Label             | Value to enter/select                                              |
      | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
      | **Select Trigger Type** | `Webhook`                                                          |
      | **Select Listener**     | `quickstart_first_last_expense_approval_listener` *(Select yours)* |
      | **Event Filter**        | *Leave this field empty*                                           |

   2. Click on the "Body" in the "Workflow Overview

      ![](/images/docs/7a9616790d77d90664cd93489448cd09620d91b63e681a6936f9e34e126f7bca-CleanShot_2025-09-02_at_09.35.41.png)

   3. Configure your system body to connect your compound action to the plugin

      * **Select Type** - System body

      * **Select an Action** - quickstart\_first\_last\_expense\_approval\_ca *(Select your Action)*

      * **Input Mapping** - Copy the below values

        * **approver: parsed\_body.approver**
        * **payload: parsed\_body.data**
        * **requested\_by: parsed\_body.requested\_by**
        * **session\_id: parsed\_body.session\_id**
        * **business\_justification: parsed\_body.details**

      <Info>
        **Understanding the Input Mapping**

        When the listener receives a webhook, we expect a JSON payload structured like this:

        JSON

        ```
        {
          "approver": "[email protected]",
          "data": {
            "amount": 300,
            "approval_id": "APV-965",
            "category": "Meals & Entertainment",
            "currency": "USD",
            "description": "Lunch meeting with a client",
            "merchant": "The Corner Bistro",
            "payment_method": "Corporate Credit Card",
            "transaction_date": "2025-09-05T10:26:00Z"
          },
          "details": "Requirement to advance to the next sales pipeline with client",
          "requested_by": "[email protected]",
          "session_id": "OW3hEkZwgLCfI2gipNAJ" # this session_id will be based on your session
        }
        ```

        The listener automatically parses this JSON payload into a `parsed_body` object. To access the data you need, you simply use dot notation to reference the keys:

        * `parsed_body.email`
        * `parsed_body.data`

        This method gives you the flexibility to extract only the specific data your compound action requires, even if the webhook sends a much larger payload.

        ***Note**: While this mapping is currently a manual process, we are developing an "Auto Configure" feature to streamline this setup in the future.*
