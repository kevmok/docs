# The Ambient Agent Blueprint

Ambient agents follow the **Listen → Understand → Act** cycle.

### Listen

Monitor systems for events, data changes, or schedules using [System Triggers](/docs/system-triggers-overview). Examples include new tickets, inactive licenses, or supply chain alerts.

### Understand and Act

Events are fed into a [Compound Action](/docs/compound-actions#/) in both phases:

* **Understand**: Analyze the event with an LLM to interpret context and assess impact.
* **Act**: Execute [Actions](/docs/actions), including API calls, scripts, or approvals.

## How Ambient Agents Work

System triggers handle the **Listen** phase and feed events into a Compound Action to **Understand** and **Act**. They use LLMs for reasoning, APIs for integration, and logs for observability.

## Example Use Cases

Ambient agents enable powerful automations across various business functions.

Here are some real-world examples:

* **SaaS License Reclamation**: An ambient IT agent that scans weekly for inactive SaaS licenses, confirms inactivity with the user, reclaims the unused licenses, and saves real dollars every week.
* **Support Ticket Auto-Triage**: An ambient customer support agent that triages new high-priority Jira tickets, attempts to reproduce issues using internal tools, looks for related open tickets, and summarizes its findings, all before a human support agent even opens the ticket.
* **Supply-Chain Disruption Response**: An ambient supply chain agent that detects potential disruptions, diagnoses the root cause, and then recommends and executes adjustments once approved.
