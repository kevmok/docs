# What are Policy Validators?

While it's appropriate to steer some behavior through natural language, enforcing **business rules** through natural language can be unreliable.

* Natural language policies are useful when there is a lot of nuance, but they are too imprecise for strict rules.

  | Example                                                                 | Optimal Steering Behavior                                          |
  | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | "If the escalation seems important, surface it to the on-call engineer" | **Natural Language**Let the LLM decide if it's important.          |
  | "If the employee is not an FTE, don't show them our FTE benefits"       | **Rules** \``` employee.status IN ["Contractor", "Contingent"]` `` |

* Natural language policies can be misunderstood by LLMs, or users might jail break them.

* The more policies you add, the less likely your AI agent will reliably enforce policies ([Lost in the Middle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172) problem).

Policy Validators enforce & guarantee that rules are **always** respected accurately — no matter how many you add.
