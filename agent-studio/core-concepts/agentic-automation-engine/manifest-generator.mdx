# What is the Manifest Generator?

When an AI agent needs to choose a tool to call, multiple similarly named tools can confuse the AI agent.

The **Manifest Generator** inspects the code in your plugins to optimize them for tool selection. You can learn more about how this is done in [our Conversation Triggers docs](/docs/natural-language-triggers) .

# How does it work?

When your users chat with your AI Assistant , the **Manifest Generator** takes the following steps:

1. Uses the conversational trigger to filter to the best plugins
2. Uses the plugin title, description, details, & trigger examples to rewrite model-facing plugin descriptions
3. Handles any end-user experience decisions (disambiguation or [parallel tool calling](/docs/multi-plugin-response-assistant#/)).
