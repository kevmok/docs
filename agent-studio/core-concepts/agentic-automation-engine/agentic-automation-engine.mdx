# Overview

The code you write (plugins) are run on the Agentic Automation Engine. Think of it as the "interpreter" for the code you've written. It prepares & optimizes your code for our [Agentic Reasoning Engine](/docs/agentic-reasoning-engine) .

* **Manifest Generator** reads your plugin's configuration and helps [Conversational AI agents](/docs/conversational-agents) understand when to use the plugin.
* **Slot Resolvers** convert natural language descriptions (e.g. "White Fox conference room") into reliable API IDs (R-3824) for your Conversational AI agents to use.
* **Policy Validators** deterministically validate your AI agents' behavior for sensitive processes (e.g. HR rules or Procurement processes)
* **Action Orchestrator** keeps the AI agent on track when executing long-running business processes.
