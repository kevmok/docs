# Assistants & AI Agents

In Moveworks, you work with AI agents through your AI Assistant. You add capabilities to your AI Assistant through **plugins.** This results in two types of AI agents:

1. **Conversational AI Agents**

   1. Users "chat" with them through the AI assistant.
   2. The intelligence is powered by our **Agentic Reasoning Engine**
   3. They have access to **one or more plugins with conversational triggers**. These are the "tools" that allow them to automate work.

2. **Ambient AI Agents**

   1. They run in the background, but can reach out to users via the AI Assistant when human input is needed.
   2. The intelligence is powered by [LLM actions](/docs/llm-actions#/).
   3. Each **plugin with a system trigger** fully controls its own execution logic & is its own Ambient AI agent.

# Plugins

Agent Studio is where you build those **Plugins**. Plugins are made up of a **Trigger** and some **Execution Logic**

* If your plugin uses a **[Conversational Trigger](/docs/natural-language-triggers#/)**, it gets compiled to a "tool" – which gives your **[Conversational AI Agents](/docs/conversational-agents#/)** more advanced capabilities. The [Agentic Reasoning Engine](/docs/agentic-reasoning-engine#/) decides when to call it & how it works with other conversational plugins.
* If your plugin uses a **[System Trigger](/docs/system-triggers-overview#/)**, it gets compiled to an [Ambient AI Agent](/docs/ambient-agents#/), which runs in the background without human intervention.

# Triggers

Triggers bridge the gap between user interactions, system events, and plugin execution. Agent Studio supports three types of triggers to cover a wide range of scenarios:

* **[Conversational Triggers](/docs/natural-language-triggers#/)**: Activated by user utterances in natural language.

* **[System Triggers](/docs/system-triggers-overview#/)** - Activated by a system, not a user

  * **[Webhook Triggers](/docs/webhook-triggers-limited-preview#/)**: Respond to external events via APIs or webhooks.
  * **[Scheduled Triggers](/docs/scheduled-triggers-limited-preview#/)**: Run plugins at specified intervals or times..
