# What are connectors?

Connectors in Moveworks are used to communicate with your systems and establish secure access to your business applications. Each connector includes authentication methods, connection name and other system specific inputs.

These connectors are reusable across different use cases in the Moveworks platform, and can be used to configure other capabilities for your Moveworks bot, such as enterprise search, ticketing and more.

There are 2 types of connectors in the Moveworks product.

* **[System Connectors](/docs/system-connectors)** are built-in connectors that are built & maintained by Moveworks, for use in Built-in Plugins. The ability to use system connections for Agent Studio Plugins is in Limited Preview. Click here for more information.
* **[HTTP Connectors](/docs/http-connectors)** are custom connectors to your business systems for use in Agent Studio Plugins.

# FAQ & Troubleshooting

**How many connectors can I create?**

* There is no limit to number of connectors that you can create.

**I created a connector with wrong credentials, what should I do next?**

* You can always create a new connector or edit the one that you created.

**My system is not listed in the select connector page.**

* It means that we do not support that integration so far. Do not worry, reach out to Customer support with the system name.

**Do I have to create separate connectors for separate skills?**

* No, if you have provided appropriate accesses to the connector, you might not create new connectors.
* For example: If you want to configure MW ticketing and MW enterprise answers.
* Go ahead and create a service account with appropriate permissions following [this](/docs/access-requirements) guide.
* Once you have the auth setup and exported the credentials, use them to create a new connector in MW setup
