Basic authentication entails sending a validated username and password along with your request.

* The Authorization header sends the API a **Base64 encoded** string that encapsulates your username and password values, preceded by the term 'Basic' in the following format:\
  `Basic Base64Encoded("<username>:<password>")`

To set this up, choose `Basic Auth` from the **Auth Config** dropdown list. Then, input your API `username` and `password` into their respective fields.
