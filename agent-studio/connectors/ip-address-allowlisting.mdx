# Trusted Certificates

You'll need to ensure your services trust requests come from our Certificate Authority. We use the standard AWS Certificates: [https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/)

```
CN=Amazon Root CA 1,O=Amazon,C=US	
CN=Amazon Root CA 2,O=Amazon,C=US
CN=Amazon Root CA 3,O=Amazon,C=US	
CN=Amazon Root CA 4,O=Amazon,C=US	
```

# IP Addresses

When connecting Moveworks' production services to your applications, you may need to allowlist the IP addresses of our applications.

You can view the IP addresses you need to allowlist via **Setup > Organization Details > General Information > Network Details**.

<Warning>
  ### Dynamic IPs

  If you notice blank values for any of these IP addresses, then your organization's production services dynamic IP addresses. This is typically dependent on your data center.
