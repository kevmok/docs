To ensure reliable performance and prevent indefinite waits, Moveworks enforces strict timeouts on plugin executions. These limits apply to **synchronous HTTP actions** (the most common type in plugins) and are designed to protect both your users and the platform.

# Key Timeout Limits 

| Scope                         | Time Limit  | What Happens If Exceeded                                       |
| :---------------------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single plugin action step** | 30 seconds  | Likely timeout – safest target for any individual HTTP request |
| **Determined execution plan** | 45 seconds  | Certain timeout                                                |
| **Entire request lifecycle**  | 160 seconds | Certain timeout                                                |

  _**Note**: A determined execution plan is the sequence of steps the system settles on to fulfill a user request. Multiple plans may be evaluated during processing, but only one is executed_

# Recommendations

* **Target \< 30 seconds per action**: Design every synchronous HTTP call to complete well under 30 seconds. This is the most reliable guardrail, even if multiple actions run sequentially within the same step.
* **Use asynchronous patterns when needed**: For operations that may exceed 30 seconds, leverage compound actions, which are asynchronous by design.
