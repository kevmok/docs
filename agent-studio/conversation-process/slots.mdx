# What are slots?

When building AI agents, you need "slots," or **input values**, to successfully execute a conversation process. These can be collected from the user or they can be data stored in your AI assistant's memory. For example...

* If you're building a plugin to close a Jira ticket, you might need a `ticket` slot.
* If you're building a plugin to rename a Slack channel, you might need a `channel` slot and a `new_name` slot.
* If you're building a plugin to submit a Workday PTO request, you might need a `num_days` slot.

# Slots Key Components

## Slot Naming and Descriptions

Slot names & descriptions are used by your Copilot to reason about your slots.

### Tip: Using Slot Descriptions to control AI Assistant behavior

Slot descriptions can be used to clarify AI Assistant slot inference and formatting behavior. Here are examples:

* Clarify how to format slot before passing it to APIs (e.g. `Timestamp should follow ALWAYS the following format: YYYY-MM-DDT23:59:59.`")
* Clarify how to set default slot values (e.g. `If the user doesn't specify start_date, set the start_date as the current date & time.`)
* Clarify disclaimers and help text for slot (e.g. `Present user a disclaimer that start_date should NOT be in the past`)
* Clarify how slot should be inferred by Copilot (e.g. `Do NOT infer the country_code from user's profile. Always ask the user explicitly for it`)

## Slot Data Types

This will determine the data type of the value that is passed into your Plugin. There are two categories of slot types:

1. **Built-in Data Types**

   * `string` - text
   * `integer` - valid integers
   * `number` - floating point numbers
   * `boolean` - true / false
   * `User` - another employee in your organization.
     * Uses built in resolver strategy

2. **Custom Data Types**
   * [See our documentation on Custom Data Types](/docs/data-types)

## Slot Validation Policy

<Warning>
  ### This feature is only supported in Agent Studio

  This is not a feature that is or will be supported in Agent Studio (Classic)
</Warning>

![](/images/docs/3e216d901769e3091fa930659c28d7255d538e9308adfc21891c2fdccc135c39-CleanShot_2025-04-09_at_03.57.34.png)

Every slot can have validate the `value` that is collected. This uses [Moveworks DSL language](/docs/moveworks-dsl-reference).

For example, if you if you have a slot called `due_date`, you may only want to collect a date value that is today or later. This condition would be: `$PARSE_TIME(value) > $TIME()`

## Slot Inference Policy

<Warning>
  ### This feature is only supported in Agent Studio

  This is not a feature that is or will be supported in Agent Studio (Classic)
</Warning>

![](/images/docs/6aece47658e57267f1d017733ac01311b4de9e99fc39bbe8cfb76a38ff70793b-CleanShot_2025-04-09_at_04.00.49.png)

Slot Inference Policy influences how the AI Assistant collects the values needed for Plugin execution. There are 2 options:

1. **Infer slot value if available**: This tells the AI Assistant to infer the value of a slot from conversation context, if available.
2. **Always explicitly ask for slot**: This tells the AI Assistant to ***always*** ask the end user for the value.

## Slot Cardinality

<Warning>
  ### This feature is only supported in Agent Studio (Classic)

  This is not a feature that is currently support in Agent Studio. We plan on adding support for List\[type] in H1 2025.
</Warning>

Every slot can either be a list or a single record. You set this when you pick the `List[type]` vs `[type]` in the dropdown.

![](/images/docs/b55b4eeece31366fa59d33b514c2f9a6d2f76ea5b96e6c9d6a88fdcb2048c197-CleanShot_2024-12-11_at_17.09.092x.png)

Users can specify lists however they see fit in the conversation.

* "1 and 2 and 3"
* "1, 2, 3"
* "\[1, 2, 3]"
* "all the numbers 1-3"

## Resolver Strategies

<Warning>
  ### This feature is only supported in Agent Studio

  This is not a feature that is or will be supported in Agent Studio (Classic)
</Warning>

Resolver strategies instructs your AI assistant on how it should convert the user’s version of the value (e.g. “my blog task”) to a Data Type the system wants (e.g. Asana task object). Read more about our unique [Slot Resolver](/docs/slot-resolvers) technology.

Any slot can inherit the resolver strategy of its data type or you can create a in-line resolver strategy in your plugin. Read more on how to configure [Resolver Strategies](/docs/resolver-strategies)

# How do I configure slots?

Slots will be explicitly defined in the **Plugin Lowcode Editor**.

# How does the AI agent ask for slots?

The AI agent will read your slot configuration and determine the best way to ask the user for the information.
