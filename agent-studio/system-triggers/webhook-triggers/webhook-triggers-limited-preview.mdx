  **Limited Preview: Webhook Triggers & Listener**

  Webhook Triggers and the Webhook Listener are currently in Limited Preview and may change without notice. Access is invite-only. Self-nomination form is [here](https://community.moveworks.com/p/webhook-triggers-limited-preview). Production use is approved but may be subject to interruptions or breaking changes.
</Warning>

Webhook triggers enable ambient agents to respond to events from applications in real time. External systems (the **provider**) send an HTTP request to the Listener (the **receiver**). The Listener validates and parses the request into an event, which activates one or more **plugins** to execute processes.

<Info>
  *"**Who is this for?***

  *Builders creating always-active automations triggered by system events, such as "New GitHub issue opened," "Offer letter signed," or "Gong call ended." For the full landscape, see [System Triggers Overview.](/docs/system-triggers-overview)"*
</Info>

## How it works

1. **Provider → Listener.** An external application sends a webhook to the **Webhook URL**, generated when creating a Listener. The Listener captures incoming requests.
2. **Listener → Event.** Moveworks authenticates and validates the request, optionally verifies a signature, parses the body and query parameters, and generates an **event**.
3. **Event → Plugin(s).** Matching plugins are evaluated and activated, executing configured processes (actions, approvals, etc.).

### How events become plugin runs

1. **Raw request received** at your Listener → `listener.webhook.trigger`.
2. **Processed & published** (or rejected/debounced) → `listener.webhook.processor.update`.
3. **Plugins evaluated & triggered** → `listener.webhook.plugin.trigger`.
4. **Process executes** → `compound_action.*` and action logs.

## Key concepts

* **Listener.** Moveworks' receiver for webhook requests. Create one per source or reuse across sources.
* **Webhook URL.** Unique HTTP endpoint for providers to send requests, enabling event creation in Moveworks.
* **Provider vs. Receiver.** The provider (e.g., GitHub, Workday, DocuSign) **sends** webhooks, while Moveworks (your Listener) **receives** them.

## Listener Capabilities

**Authentication & security**

* **Signature (HMAC) verification** - configure a shared secret to allow Moveworks to confirm the request originates from your provider.
* **Auth header** - require bearer token or API key.
* **Currently unsupported** - mTLS, asymmetric keys, JWKs, or JWTs.

> Why secure? Without auth/signature, anyone who knows your URL can attempt to trigger your workflow. Unsecured listeners are heavily rate-limited (e.g., 1 req / 10s) vs. significantly higher limits for secured listeners.

**Event filtering**

* **Listener-Level Filters**: Drop irrelevant events at the entry point (e.g., accept only `issues.opened`, ignore `issues.edited`).
* Supported at listener and plugin levels for reuse.

**Deduplication & replay protection**

* Prevent duplicate requests from triggering the same plugin twice; logs will show debounced/skipped events.

**One-time verification challenges**

* Handle challenge/CRC requests during provider registration.

## Platform rules and limitations

* **One trigger paradigm per plugin.** A plugin can be triggered by *system triggers* (one or many), **or** by *conversational triggers* (one or many)—but not both. Duplicate the plugin if you need both paradigms.
* **Multiple plugins per event.** A single event can fan-out to multiple plugins if their conditions match.

## Logs & observability

Trace any event end-to-end with three new log types:

* `listener.webhook.trigger`: Confirms the raw request reached your Listener, including headers, method, parsed body, and timestamps.
* `listener.webhook.processor.update`: Displays the processing outcome (published, failed with reason, or debounced) and the normalized payload.
* `listener.webhook.plugin.trigger`: Indicates which plugins were evaluated, activated, skipped, failed, or expired (TTL).

See the **[Webhook Logs & Troubleshooting](https://help.moveworks.com/update/docs/webhook-logs-troubleshooting-guide#/)** guide for playbooks on diagnosing issues such as "Why didn't my plugin run?"

### Appendix (glossary)

* **Webhook:** Automated notification sent by a provider on an event.
* **Webhook Event (Payload):** Data package in the request, typically JSON.
* **Headers:** Metadata such as event type, request IDs, or signatures.
* **System Trigger:** Non-conversational trigger (e.g., webhook) initiating a plugin.
