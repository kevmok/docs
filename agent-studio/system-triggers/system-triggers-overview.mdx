## How triggers connect to your processes

In Agent Studio, **Plugins** are modular workflows built around two essential elements:

* **Trigger**: Defines the activation condition (when to run)
* **Process**: Outlines the sequence of actions (what it does)

System Triggers feed events directly into the Process, enabling end-to-end automation without manual intervention, allowing the agent to reason and act.

### Webhooks at a glance (Limited Preview)

To configure webhooks:

* Create a **Listener** for event providers like Salesforce or Asana.
* Moveworks validates incoming events, supporting signed secrets and one-time challenge verification.
* Events are parsed and dispatched to matching plugins, with observability provided through dedicated logs.

> For hands-on steps, see [Webhook Triggers (Limited Preview)](/docs/webhook-triggers-limited-preview) and the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/webhook-triggers-quickstart-guide#/).

## Choosing the right trigger

* Use **Webhooks** for real-time responses to system events.
* Use **Pollers** (upcoming) for systems without native webhooks.
* Use **Scheduled** for recurring tasks like weekly audits.

```

1. **Trigger Activates**: An event, change, or schedule initiates the process.
2. **Moveworks Processes the Trigger**: Validates and parses the trigger (e.g., a webhook).
3. **Matching Plugin(s) Execute**: The configured **Process** runs, using LLM reasoning, API calls, and optional approvals.
4. **Logs Provide Traceability**: Monitor each stage end-to-end during development and operations.
