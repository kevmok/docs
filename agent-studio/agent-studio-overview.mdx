# Agentic Frameworks

Agent Studio lets you connect AI assistants to your business systems & content. There are three **Agentic Frameworks** that you can build on.

  Execute real-time actions to create, modify, read, & remove data from business systems.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Ambient AI Agents" icon="infinity" href="/docs/ambient-agents">

These agentic frameworks are interoperable on the Moveworks platform, so you can build experiences that span multiple patterns.

# Samples
