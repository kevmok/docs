If you're building an integration with a tool like Snowflake, you might get a response that looks something like this:

```

There's basically an array of Column Definitions, and then a 2D array of data. To make this data more LLM (and human) friendly, you'll want to convert it using a Data Mapper. So for example, if that API response came from an action-based activity, you would map it like this:

```yaml
MAP():
	items: response.data
	converter:
		MERGE():
			FLATTEN():
      - "item.$MAP((x, i) => {response.resultSetMetaData.rowType[i].name: x})"
```
