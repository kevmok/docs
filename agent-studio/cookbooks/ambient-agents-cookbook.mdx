description: "Ambient agents can leverage different trigger types, each with its own architecture for handling events, changes, or scheduled tasks. Below are sequence diagrams illustrating the flow for each trigger type."

## Webhook Trigger Architecture

This diagram shows an ambient agent responding to a real-time webhook event, such as monitoring CPU usage and scaling resources if needed.

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Admin
    participant P as Ambient Agent
    participant B1 as Backend System 1
    P->>B1: Monitor Webhook Trigger
    B1->>P: Send Webhook Event (CPU Usage)
    P->>P: Interpret and Validate Event
    P->>P: Check: Is CPU Usage > 80%?
    alt CPU Usage > 80%
        P->>B1: Execute Action (Scale Resources)
        B1->>P: Return Result
    else CPU Usage ≤ 80%
        P->>P: Log Event
    end
    P->>A: Deliver Notification
```

## Scheduled Trigger Architecture

This diagram depicts an ambient agent executing a workflow at a predefined time, such as generating a report on new feature requests every Monday morning.

<Warning>
  Do not use scheduled triggers to run a task for **every employee**. Instead, you should aim to run a task for **every record** in a business process.
</Warning>

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Admin
    participant P as Ambient Agent
    participant B1 as Backend System 1
    participant B2 as Backend System 2
    P->>P: Scheduled Trigger (Every Monday @ 9am)
    P->>B1: Get All New Feature Requests
    B1->>P: Return Feature Request Data
    P->>P: Compare to WIP Memos
    P->>P: Identify Relevant PM
    P->>B2: Assign Task to PM
    B2->>P: Return Assignment Result
    P->>P: Generate Summary Report
    P->>A: Deliver Report
    A->>A: Receive Report
```
