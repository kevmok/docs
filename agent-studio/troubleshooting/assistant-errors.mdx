Here, you can find troubleshooting instructions for all errors that happen inside your Moveworks Assistant.

# Plugin not selected by Assistant

### Possible cause: Plugin not deployed

**To fix:** Your plugins can take up to 2 minutes to be deployed after launch. Please wait & try again.

### Possible cause: Failed access control

**To fix:** Make sure your [identity](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/control-centre-identity) matches your [launch options](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/launch-configuration#/). Data is case sensitive.

### Possible cause: Assistant believed your plugin was irrelevant

Natural language may not have found your chat message similar to the trained examples.

**To fix:** Try adding the new chat messages as positive examples to the `Edit Triggering` stage & test again.

**To fix:** Try updating your plugin name & description to be more clear.

# Plugin questions are confusing / drop details

Assistant use reasoning & chat context to ask more natural questions but it may drop important details.

**To fix:** Setup descriptive slot names: Make sure your [slot names](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/slots#agent-studio-classic) are 1. descriptive & 2. unique from other slot names. Assistant will be more accurate when generating questions if it clearly understands the purpose of your slots.

**To fix:** Consider setting up your slots as explicit questions so that the question dialog doesn't get skipped.

# Plugin drops-off during follow ups

### Possible cause: Plugin dropped previous slots from its context

**To fix:** To improve Assistant's ability to retain slots, set up descriptive slot names & question details.

**To fix:** Check if you can reduce plugin complexity. Generally the more the number of slots, the higher risk of dropoffs:

* Remove extra event slots that are not useful.
* Check if multiple event slots can be combined into 1 larger event slot.
* Check if extra Path branches can be combined or reduced.

### Possible cause: Plugin found another plugin to be more relevant

**To fix:** Add re-triggering instructions to plugin description: e.g. Continue selecting this plugin for PTO balance related issues.

# API call fails in a plugin

Your Path fails when you get the message: `Unfortunately, I ran into an issue and can't directly help you at the moment.` This typically happens due to a malformed API connection.

### Possible cause: Invalid characters in API endpoint

We don’t support special characters in the API endpoint path.

**To fix:** Make sure you only include letters (`a … Z`), numbers (`0 … 9`) or slashes (`/`) in your endpoint path.

### Possible cause: No opening slash `/` or trailing slashes `/` in API endpoint

**To fix:** ✅ Ensure there’s an opening slash

**To fix:** ❌ Make sure there’s no trailing slash

![](https://files.readme.io/64718b25c4d8f99633836f0fecbb9f4260d90c7b942a5eb0b5129866ebef2cba-troubleshooting_10.png)

### Possible cause: Invalid reference to the user’s email in API

**To fix:** Make sure to use `{{user_email_addr}}` to reference the internally stored user’s email. This value is only available in the endpoint URL, Query Param, & the Request Body Bender.

### Possible cause: Invalid reference to a user question in API

**To fix:** User question responses are reference-able using the `{{question prompt}}` notation. Again, these prompts are only available in the endpoint URL, Query Param, & the Request Body Bender. Accessing this information from another field may cause this error.

# Assistant is extracting wrong user slots

### Possible cause: Assistant isn't trained to extract your slots

**To fix**: To improve Assistant's ability to extract slots accurately, set up descriptive slot names & question details.

**To fix**: For Queries, add examples of slot extraction to clarify how Assistant should extract slots from your utterances.
